# MP3 Downloader

This is a Python script that uses `yt-dlp` to download MP3 audio from YouTube videos. The script allows the user to enter a YouTube video URL and downloads the audio to an MP3 file.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- `yt-dlp` (a fork of `youtube-dl`) installed and added to the system path. You can download `yt-dlp` from [here](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp).

## Usage

You'll be prompted to enter a YouTube video URL. Once you enter the URL, the script will download the audio to an MP3 file and save it in a folder called "done" in the same directory as the script.
